        <p>Other churches have late evening services perhaps at 11 pm, so that the church can celebrate christmas day together with the ringing of bells at midnight. Pathfinder church has christmas services and holiday events and performances for the whole family. At 7:00 pm we will have a beautiful and meaningful time of worship during our candlelight service.</p>
